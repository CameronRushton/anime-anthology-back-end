Gabriel Dropout - Really hard to find a stream of. Not a bad show. Moe, kinda funny. A little aimless.

Description
There are 5 levels defined in this anthology.

Level 1:
Shoyu's top 10 anime ever seen, in no particular order.
I guarantee that at last one of these shows is in your top 10 as well.

Level 2:
Other great anime that didn't quite make the cut into the top 10. They are the runners up.

Level 3:
These are good and some are great anime, but for various reasons, didn't make it to the top. Generally,
anime that are in lower levels are worse, but this isn't always the case.
You should watch these anime after you watch some of the ones (or all) in the first two levels.
At this point, you should be a certified weeb and are losing your grip on life because of how great
this is.

Level 4:
This level has anime that I wouldn't recommend for beginners. It may be complex, not define the anime genre well and turn people off
or are just not good to watch. Since you should watch shows in this level after you're done with the other three levels, you
may find some shows here to be either straight bad, or extremely interesting because of how complex or different the show is.
Quality is very hit or miss. This is near the end game.

Level 5:
The end game. There is no more good anime to watch. This is where you'll find the crap, cringe and everything in between.
Maybe you like a show in here - fine, but personally, I would recommend any other show from any other level first before even
mentioning that a show in this level exists. Venture here as a last resort.

Level 6: TODO

-----------------**Level 1 - New to anime? Start with these. There will be something you like in here. We're just skimming the surface**-----------------
1 {
RECOMMENDED TO WATCH AT LEAST 4 OF THESE TO CONTINUE TO LEVEL 2
https://anilist.co/anime/11061/Hunter-x-Hunter-2011/ Nice show about a kid becoming stronger and finding his dad. Dont think they did the chimera ant arc well because Gon's emotions aren't justified enough, but was entertaining nonetheless.
https://anilist.co/anime/205/Samurai-Champloo/ No bullshit super powers. Clean samurai fights. Watch the dub.
https://anilist.co/anime/20605/Tokyo-Ghoul/ Kid becomes a ghoul (basically has super powers) and now fights humans n stuff. This and the second season are pretty good, but :re is very not good. My dad thought the first bit of this one was cool though.
https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/ Groundhog day with loli maid waifus (Ram best girl btw)
https://anilist.co/anime/20954/Koe-no-Katachi/ This one hits you in the feels quite hard. Typical Kyoto Animation story. Just watch it.
https://anilist.co/anime/21519/Kimi-no-Na-wa/ Top anime movie of all time. Basically anime Freaky Friday but way more interesting.
https://anilist.co/anime/9253/SteinsGate/ Bioshock infinite quantum mechanics happening in this one. Insanely good show. Every season is amazing. Difficult to get into and sometimes hard to understand but wow this is advanced. I appreciate the writing very much.
https://anilist.co/anime/5114/Fullmetal-Alchemist-brotherhood/ Top classic adventure. Laws of equivalent exchange when rearranging molecules using magic. This is literally the best anime on multiple pages.
https://anilist.co/anime/164/Mononoke-hime/ Wolf princess saves the world with the MC
https://anilist.co/anime/16498/Shingeki-no-Kyojin/ Titans are eating our asses and I'm not into vore. Show gets fairly political and you're in the dark for a large portion of it but season 3 gets very good once more info is known.
https://anilist.co/anime/104578/Shingeki-no-Kyojin-3-Part-2/ This is where the show really develops and you understand so much more. Very good season.
https://anilist.co/anime/199/Sen-to-Chihiro-no-Kamikakushi/ This is basically a disney film like princess mononoke. Suitable for all ages.
}
----------------------------**Level 2 - Yeah anime is cool, let's dig a little deeper. There's a few here you need to see**----------------------------

2 {
RECOMMENDED TO WATCH AT LEAST 5 OF THESE TO CONTINUE TO LEVEL 3

https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howl-no-Ugoku-Shiro/ Another disney-like movie
https://anilist.co/anime/13125/Shinsekai-yori/ This one hits you a little hard because the scenarios the kids are put in reflect the real world on a grand scale. Ethnicity, government politics, religion and other themes with some other dark themes. Still a very good show.
https://anilist.co/anime/21827/Violet-Evergarden/ The story is lackluster and I dont find the MC, Violet, very interesting, and shes sort of meant to be... damaged, but the show is beautiful. This is one of those shows that makes you want to take up a hobby and this one is writing stories on a typewriter. There is one story that arcs the entire season but while this is happening, there's several, more powerful stories that are really deep.
https://anilist.co/anime/99263/Tate-no-Yuusha-no-Nariagari/ Never before have I seen a better revenge story in anime. Theres lots of action in this one. Great show.
https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/ This show is an instant classic. It's really hard to find things very wrong with this show. I find it defines what anime is very well. The MC is very likable and the show blends dark themes with the shounen adventure genre very well. I could say this exact thing for Fullmetal Alchemist and that is a great show.
https://anilist.co/anime/97983/Natsume-Yuujinchou-Roku/ The Natsume series is fairly large spanning many seasons. It's all very chill but enough action to keep your attention. Very nice to watch in between your big action anime. The MC inherits a book of spirits' names that his grandmother won defeating each spirit and Natsume aims to return all the spirits' names. The spirits make for very interesting characters as we typically see in anime.
https://anilist.co/anime/17265/Log-Horizon/ This is one of those shows that make you want to do something. In this case, it's MMORPGs! Unfortunately season 2 is more boring, but this show still deserves a spot here. Our MC is a very intelligent strategist mage (the villain in glasses) that aims to free everyone from the MMO world they were trapped in. Yeah it's one of those.
https://anilist.co/anime/99457/Sayonara-no-Asa-ni-Yakusoku-no-Hana-wo-Kazarou/ What if you lived forever? This show answers that question. There were some parts that could have been done better, but the message is clear in the end. Very solid. Will give you a different outlook on life.
https://anilist.co/anime/1535/Death-Note/ This is a classic. Probably the most thought to ever go into strategy at the time of its release. I'd say for sure that steins;gate surpasses it in that regard, but this show is so cool. What would you do if you could kill anyone by knowing their name and face?
https://anilist.co/anime/97986/Made-in-Abyss/ Episode 11 is a little... disturbing, but this is an excellent adventure show. Reminds me of the time I booted up Minecraft or something similar for the first time and explored the world.
https://anilist.co/anime/2167/Clannad/ Another Kyoto Animation special that will hit you in the feels. This is just build up to season 2, so if you like this, it gets better. This show goes through life from school to being an adult and it's a ride that a lot of people aren't ready for.
https://anilist.co/anime/20832/Overlord/ Overlord is another one of those 'trapped in an MMORPG' shows, but this time, it's just our MC and hes SUPER OP. The first season is just him trying out stuff and seeing how OP he really is, but the next couple seasons develop the plot towards world domination and it's very cool! Lots of world building, which people complained about, but shows shouldn't always be about action. Our MC also isn't inherently good! He can be considered neutral evil which is actually very refreshing!
https://anilist.co/anime/100182/Sword-Art-Online-Alicization/ People bash SAO a lot but it really doesnt deserve all the hate. Yeah, I didnt like a lot of it either, but this show is different. Asuna is almost non-existent and Kirito isn't as OP. Give it a watch in between your main shows if you've already seen SAO.
https://anilist.co/anime/20829/Owari-no-Seraph/ I remember the characters are a little gay, and the vampires disturb me a little, but this show was still nice to watch. Lots of action.
https://anilist.co/anime/356/Fatestay-night/ The fate series is so huge. This one is very good though. Unlimited blade works is the version you should watch. Great action. Kinda like a hunger games thing.
https://anilist.co/anime/10620/Mirai-Nikki-TV/ This show is the embodiment of my first girlfriend. Yuno is absolutely crazy about her boyfriend, Yuki, and Yuki just deals with it. This game is literally the hunger games but the gimmick is that everyone has a type of 'future diary' of their own.
(Netflix Only https://www.netflix.com/watch/80095340) Castlevania - So NA CAN make anime. WOW. This one is also pretty damn good. If you liked Hellsing, you'll like this. Vampires and vampire slayers.
https://anilist.co/anime/99423/Darling-in-the-Franxx/ This one has zero two in it. That's the best thing about this show. I still think Ichigo is best girl. Theres some themes here that give it some big mood, but the end parts were way rushed. Theme is VERY similar to suisei no garagntia.
https://anilist.co/anime/98436/Mahoutsukai-no-Yome/ Another beautiful show like violet evergarden. Ending wasn't great, but boy was the journey magical. Excellent show.
https://anilist.co/anime/11887/Kokoro-Connect/ This show is a little bit life changing. It's about a group of kids that get crazy twists developing in their life because some god is bored and they are interesting. One time they can read each other's mind, another time they swap bodies, etc, and the group has to deal with the aftermath. The experiment ends when they show signs of personal growth.
https://anilist.co/anime/101291/Seishun-Buta-Yarou-wa-Bunny-Girlsenpai-no-Yume-wo-Minai/ I thought this show was going to be stupid. Holy shit was I wrong. This show is almost as good as monogatari. It's similar. There's some time of 'adolescence syndrome' that changes the world in some way and like Kokoro connect, the characters grow up. Also the MC one of the most real, sarcastic and lovable. Best MC award hands down.
https://anilist.co/anime/101759/Yakusoku-no-Neverland/ Another dark show... These kids are fighting to survive in a tricky spot. That's all I can say. It's so amazing though. Lots of thought went into this.
https://anilist.co/anime/21459/Boku-no-Hero-Academia/ I'd recommend this show for anyone. Great for all ages. I dont like super heroes, but I still watched all seasons of it till the end. You should too!
https://anilist.co/anime/101280/Tensei-Shitara-Slime-Datta-Ken/ Issekai genre is still alive! Super basic story that has been done a million times, but this is so fresh. Reminds me of Overlord but you're the good guy this time.
}
3 {
------------------------------------------------------**Level 3 - Good anime you can live without**------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDED TO WATCH AT LEAST 10 OF THESE TO CONTINUE TO LEVEL 4
https://anilist.co/anime/21087/One-Punch-Man/ Man kills anything in one punch. He's the strongest. Makes for REALLY boring fights. People say season 2 is worse but I think it's better because our MC isn't in it as much. It's a great show that only deserves one season and no more.
https://anilist.co/anime/99420/Shoujo-Shuumatsu-Ryokou/ This one should be watched in between your main shows. It's very atmospheric as two girls travel and mess around in a post-apocalyptic, futuristic ruin of a world. Very cool. Be warned though, there's not much action - there's not meant to be.
https://anilist.co/anime/10087/FateZero/ Another Fate edition which is also very good.
https://anilist.co/anime/8425/Gosick/ This whole show is a great adventure with a main theme of solving mysteries. Quite enjoyable.
https://anilist.co/anime/21428/Hai-to-Gensou-no-Grimgar/ This is another MMORPG isekai but this time, the things you kill to level up are exactly as dangerous as you would expect them irl. No goblin that can think for itself is going to let you kill it. They have a family too.
https://anilist.co/anime/20447/Noragami/ Love this OP. The story is OK. Our MC is a god but he has no followers so he kinda just hangs out and stuff. Ends up going on a bit of an adventure. Good amounts of action. Kinda reminds me of Bleach.
https://anilist.co/anime/16524/Suisei-no-Gargantia/ This is the main story of FranXX done right but without some of the group dynamics and filler themes of FranXX. Not as popular, but I like the story more. If you just want hot girls like Zero two, go back to FranXX.
https://anilist.co/anime/11757/Sword-Art-Online/ Another video game isekai but in this one, when you die, you die for real. Honestly not the worst. Everyone hates on it, but it's still very popular and Asuna won best girl #6(?) award in 2019 as voted by reddit. Arc 1 in Aincrad was pretty good! Fairies thing was very bad, recycled, fan service fetish garbage, and arc 3 being GGO was pretty good. GGO alternative was also pretty good.
https://anilist.co/anime/19815/No-Game-No-Life/ The MCs are the best at games. Lots of strategy involved. It's another isekai, but it's cool cause our human MCs show the world that humans are not to be messed with. It's too bad there's no season 2. A lot of people really like this one. It's also super colourful.
https://anilist.co/anime/269/Bleach/ Long adventure of our MC becoming more OP after he dies (every fight) and comes back stronger. Gets really stale after a while, but is still a good watch for a couple hundred episodes. Definitely can skip some episodes though. Lots of filler and 1 on 1 fights could last 4 episodes.
https://anilist.co/anime/889/Black-Lagoon/ My dad liked this one. Business man turns into a modern pirate. The nuns are also great too.
https://anilist.co/anime/21123/DRIFTERS/ A good show to watch in between other shows especially if you like history and action. Basically, two gods are battling it out by sending famous people to a world where they fight in mortal combat.
https://anilist.co/anime/14467/K/ Very difficult to search for this one because it's only one letter. I really like this show. It's mostly about gang wars, but something about it is just cool to watch and our MC is pretty interesting.
https://anilist.co/anime/20913/K-Return-Of-Kings/ Watch this after watching the main series.
https://anilist.co/anime/21403/Sword-Art-Online-Movie-Ordinal-Scale/ This movie is actually good. Great fight scenes. Fine story. A good watch after you've seen all of SAO (SAO, Fairy crap, GGO) because characters from all 3 arcs show up.
https://anilist.co/anime/21613/Youjo-Senki/ A loli is the leader of a Nazi army and damn is she scary. This is also an isekai because our MC is killed by a god and as punishment he takes the form of this little girl. Good show.
https://anilist.co/anime/777/Hellsing-Ultimate/ Vampires and vampire slayers. Oh and hitler. and the church. Lots of blood, dark themes and an Irish priest named Alexander Anderson voiced by a Japanese man speaking english sometimes. You know it's good.
https://anilist.co/anime/1818/Claymore/ These girls are basically witchers like how Geralt is in the witcher series. Pretty dark but very cool still. Not AAA but still cool.
https://anilist.co/anime/101347/Dororo/ This one is AAA. Great revenge story. The original was released in the 60s or something and wow this is a big step up. Remember, Dororo is the child. Don't get them confused.
https://anilist.co/anime/20613/Akame-ga-Kill/ This was one of the first anime I've ever watched. The first was Attack on Titan. The show isn't amazing, but the action was damn cool and each character has their own ultimate ability based on their weapon.
https://anilist.co/anime/20920/Dungeon-ni-Deai-wo-Motomeru-no-wa-Machigatteiru-Darou-ka/ One of those isekai where you're put into a game but this time you're not very popular, have a crush and basically no one by your side. Sorta a love story with MMORPG elements and action and stuff. Still a good watch.
https://anilist.co/anime/11617/High-School-DxD/ Basically just hentai with more plot.
https://anilist.co/anime/8074/Gakuen-Mokushiroku-HIGHSCHOOL-OF-THE-DEAD/ Basically just hentai with more plot, boob jiggle physics rendered by the strongest video card and physX software and more zombies.
https://anilist.co/anime/21563/Clockwork-Planet/ This show isn't great, but I like it because of the machines and gears. That stuff is so cool.
https://anilist.co/anime/21838/Shuumatsu-no-Izetta/ Loli that's magical and turns the tide of war for this small country.
https://anilist.co/anime/100077/Hinamatsuri/ Yakuza, eh? Have fun taking care of this alien brat that can kick your ass. The other blonde girl almost won the best girl #6 award too. She was somewhere in the top 8 or 4.
https://anilist.co/anime/21365/Dagashi-Kashi/ This one makes you want to experience Japanese candy. It's also very lewd and pretty funny! Good to watch in between shows.
https://anilist.co/anime/97768/Grancrest-Senki Yeah cool show. Wonder why this was never mainstream. Episode 9 though... WHAT??? I've been sitting here just like WHAT???? for 10 minutes. WHY? IS THIS A FEMALE THING IM TOO MALE TO UNDERSTAND? WHAT THE FUCK. I DONT GET IT. THIS MAKES NO SENSE ANYMORE. THE ENTIRE SHOW WAS ALL ABOUT FACTS AND LOGIC AND REASONING AND THEN THIS EPISODE HAPPENS. WHAT??? Milza is needlessly too OP. He defys all logic. He should have died so many times. He can even do things like 1 v 20 while surrounded and hold up a fully armour suited man with the tip of his sword with one hand. And how dumb is the Rossini shit? Dumb. First the head Rossini guy is like... we should be careful around Theo and whatnot but then Salvadore Rossini is like can I go kill him alone? and they be like OK and then wow guess what... mhm no spoilers here but you can guess. Last few episodes are extremely predictable. Undefeatable bosses pop up out of nowhere and they die very quick. Seems rushed and pretty boring to watch.
https://anilist.co/anime/21202/Kono-Subarashii-Sekai-ni-Shukufuku-wo/ This is my dad's favourite out of the ones we watched. It's everyone's favourite. I have to keep it in a lower level though, because there's some themes in it that would be a little too weird for a complete normie to watch. Yes, game isekai, but just watch it. It's so funny and Aqua, Darkness and Megumin are in it. Do it.
https://anilist.co/anime/21507/Mob-Psycho-100/ I didnt fully watch this one. I didnt like it. But a lot of people say it's great and Mob's character development is phenomenal.
https://anilist.co/anime/11843/Danshi-Koukousei-no-Nichijou/ Guy version of Nichijou. Pretty funny. Comedy isnt as high level as nichijou, which might make this better for normies. It's quite funny.
https://anilist.co/anime/101921/Kaguyasama-wa-Kokurasetai-Tensaitachi-no-Renai-Zunousen/ This show was memed about and beloved by everyone for many months. It's the story of what happens when two tsunderes love each other. Very funny.
https://anilist.co/anime/21701/Kuzu-no-Honkai/ This one is one of the big romance anime... it hits a few fetishes and I can relate to some of the characters. It portrays relationships in a realistic way though it is sometime a bit extraordinary.
https://anilist.co/anime/20812/SHIROBAKO/ This one makes me stressed. The deadlines of making anime are too much. I couldn't finish this one.
https://anilist.co/anime/21049/ReLife/ I could relate to this one. Some people may have made the wrong decisions in highschool and need a redo. This one may change you a little.
https://anilist.co/anime/13759/Sakurasou-no-Pet-na-Kanojo/ Crazy things that may happen when you live in a small dorm with interesting people.
https://anilist.co/anime/14813/Yahari-Ore-no-Seishun-Love-Comedy-wa-Machigatteiru/ This is a school romance anime that breaks down friendships, dating and social interactions.
https://anilist.co/anime/99468/Karakai-Jouzu-no-Takagisan/ This one sucks. Some people like it though. Might be worth a watch in between your normal programming.
https://anilist.co/anime/99131/Comic-Girls/ I like moe trash and this hits the spot real nice. Good to watch between your normal stuff. It's just cute girls doing stuff and making comics.
https://anilist.co/anime/98439/Mitsuboshi-Colors/ Cute, little girls doin random funny stuff. I like moe trash.
https://anilist.co/anime/21776/Kobayashisan-Chi-no-Maidragon/ This one is super popular. Our MC has a whole dragon family and it's funny. It would be higher up if it weren't a as anime as it is. This one is one of the better ones of this level.
https://anilist.co/anime/21455/New-Game/ Moe girls making a video game. More focused on the art and animation. It's pretty good.
https://anilist.co/anime/98693/Slow-Start/ Just some moe trash. Not amazing, but feel free to watch it if you've got nothing better to do. Nothing particularly interesting happens.
https://anilist.co/anime/103572/5Toubun-no-Hanayome/ Team Nino? Team Miku? Team Yotsuba? Team Itsuki? Team Ichika? If you've ever heard this before, this show will tell you whats up.
https://anilist.co/anime/103139/Domestic-na-Kanojo/ So the MC has a thing with this girl then she becomes his step sister and then he loves his teacher... who is also his new step sister... ugh. I still watched it, but boy this is a big dumpster fire that you just cant look away from because it's such a big fire. Show was pretty OK though. It had moments where I was like WTF and had to stop but meh, if you like weird fetish romance stuff, try it.
https://anilist.co/anime/10495/Yuru-Yuri/ Moe trash where some girls hangout and do cute and funny things.
https://anilist.co/anime/98444/Yuru-Camp/ Okay, this is great moe trash. So so so comfy. It's girls camping and omg it's great. Everyone likes this one. Watch it. Do it.
https://anilist.co/anime/97592/Demichan-wa-Kataritai/ This one is cute. Not amazing, but the idea is that these girls are very different and we learn that it's okay.
https://anilist.co/anime/97617/Isekai-Shokudou/ This is Shokugeki no Souma but without the clothes off food-gasm. Very nice restaurant that feeds very interesting regular characters. Great show. Excellent choice to watch in between your main shows.
https://anilist.co/anime/20923/Shokugeki-no-Souma/ Cooking school competitions. Fantastic show. Pretty well defined its own genre of cooking anime. It's amazing.
https://anilist.co/anime/21518/Shokugeki-no-Souma-Ni-no-Sara/ The show just gets better and better. It really doesn't get bad.
https://anilist.co/anime/99255/Shokugeki-no-Souma-San-no-Sara/ Even after the third plate, I still want more.
https://anilist.co/anime/20722/Barakamon/ I didnt really like this one, but it's apparently good. A calligrapher looks to find himself and perfect his work while away. It's pretty funny.
https://anilist.co/anime/103871/Zombie-Land-Saga/ VA of Hyojin Kyoma from Steins;Gate. Mostly about idols and less about zombies. Still a good watch.

------------------------------------------------------------------**Level 4 - Near end game**------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDED TO WATCH AT LEAST 70 TOTAL SHOWS TO CONTINUE TO LEVEL 5 OR VENTURE FORTH AS A LAST RESORT IF YOU'RE BRAVE

https://anilist.co/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari/ Monogatari is legendary. One of the best shows I've seen EVER. The watch order is highly debated. I would recommend two different watch orders. Watch this one first. Now, before I continue, this series happened like Halo did. Release 1 - 3 then Reach's events happened before 1, etc... The most important thing in this show is when you watch the movie about what happens first chronologically. This was released in 2017, well into the series. Purists will tell you to watch it like they had to when the series was airing, meaning the movie way at the end, but this is not at all how the original LN/author wanted you to see it. Only do the airing order route if you watch EVERYTHING within a month so that you can remember what happens because each story is VERY much connected and sometimes runs parallel to other stories.
https://anilist.co/anime/11597/Nisemonogatari/ Watch me second for airing order. Watch me fourth for chronological order.
https://anilist.co/anime/15689/Nekomonogatari-Kuro/ Watch me third for airing order. Watch me second for chronological order.
https://anilist.co/anime/17074/Monogatari-Series-Second-Season/ Watch me fourth for airing order. For chronological order, watch Mayoi Jiangshi (a certain range of episodes here) then Shinobu Time, then Owarimonogatari first season: Shinobu Mail, then second season: Tsubasa Tiger, Owari first season: Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, Sodachi Lost then back to second season: Nadeko Medusa, then Hitagi End.
https://anilist.co/anime/20593/Hanamonogatari/ Watch me fifth for airing order. Watch me second last for chronological order - after Zoku owarimonogatari and before Koyomimonogatari.
https://anilist.co/anime/20918/Tsukimonogatari/ Watch me sixth for airing order. Watch me after Hitagi End in the second season for chronological order.
https://anilist.co/anime/21262/Owarimonogatari/ Watch me seventh for airing order. Jump to here a bunch of times during the second season for chronological order.
https://anilist.co/anime/21745/Owarimonogatari-Ge/ Watch me ninth for airing order. Watch me after Tsukimonogatari for chronological order.
https://anilist.co/anime/100815/Zoku-Owarimonogatari/ Watch me tenth for airing order. Watch me after owarimonogatari second season (Ge) and before Hanamonogatari for chronological order.
https://anilist.co/anime/21520/Koyomimonogatari/ Watch me eighth for airing order. Watch me last for chronological order - I'd agree, always watch this last.
https://anilist.co/anime/9260/Kizumonogatari-I-Tekketsuhen/ This is the movie that is a prequel to everything that happened. Watch me SECOND (after bakemonogatari) if you are not going to binge watch ALL of monogatari.
https://anilist.co/anime/21399/Kizumonogatari-II-Nekketsuhen/ Second part of the monogatari prequel. I think what happened is that since these movies are only enough content for 6 episodes, the studio didnt want to animate it for a full 12 episode season cause there's not enough material so they started with bakemonogatari and then didnt touch this one until they were finished everything else, though this is just speculation.
https://anilist.co/anime/21400/Kizumonogatari-III-Reiketsuhen/ Third part of the monogatari prequel.
https://anilist.co/anime/21733/Shouwa-Genroku-Rakugo-Shinjuu-Sukeroku-Futatabihen/ Some people think this is really good but I tried twice but can't bring myself to watch it. It's just boring.
https://anilist.co/anime/97766/Gamers/ School romance drama with video games involved. Whole thing is full of misunderstandings are you just want everyone to communicate.
https://anilist.co/anime/21196/Koutetsujou-no-Kabaneri/ Cool zombie show but damn is the end slowly worse and worse.
https://anilist.co/anime/14075/Zetsuen-no-Tempest/ Neat show. Not AAA, but close. Good action and interesting plot.
https://anilist.co/anime/21092/Rakudai-Kishi-no-Eiyuutan/ Romance with swords and stuff... bit of fan service... really meh show, but it wasnt the worst. Reminds me of absolute duo.
https://anilist.co/anime/2025/Darker-than-BLACK-Kuro-no-Keiyakusha/ CHINESE ELECTRIC BATMAN 'nuff said.
https://anilist.co/anime/1726/Devil-May-Cry/ Man likes murdering demons and strawberry sundaes.
https://anilist.co/anime/99629/Satsuriku-no-Tenshi/ Our MC is really screwed up in the head and she goes through many floors of nightmares as we uncover her back story and why an innocent little girl in here.
https://anilist.co/anime/8769/Ore-no-Imouto-ga-Konna-ni-Kawaii-Wake-ga-Nai/
https://anilist.co/anime/15809/Hataraku-Maousama/ Devil is a part-timer at McDonalds and enjoys it.
https://anilist.co/anime/10165/Nichijou/
https://anilist.co/anime/97832/Citrus/ Ending drama is stupid, otherwise alright show
https://anilist.co/anime/104454/Isekai-Quartet/ Good show. Just very extra and half as long. Should watch all four isekais before starting it. (Youjo senki, Overlord, Re:Zero, Konosuba)

-------------------------------**Level 5 - I've seen it all; there's nothing notable to watch. Let's really dig in the depths of anime hell**-------------------------------

https://anilist.co/anime/20457/Black-Bullet/ Earth defense force 2025
https://anilist.co/anime/226/Elfen-Lied/ Did you really think that Stranger Things was OC? HA. Yeah, it was based on this show. The things you know and love all boil down to anime.
https://anilist.co/anime/98320/Koi-to-Uso/ Another romance show but damn the MC is so indecisive. Watch the beginning... it's cute and seems good, but damn does it go down hill.
https://anilist.co/anime/21472/Oshiete-Galkochan/ Just don't bother. Move along.
https://anilist.co/anime/21452/Seikaisuru-Kado/ What if you gave the world infinite energy and other alien things? This show answers that. They need to stop with the CG though... holy.
https://anilist.co/anime/97730/Seiren/ I completely forget what this show was. That's how uneventful it was. Forget about it.
https://anilist.co/anime/3588/Soul-Eater/ I don't like the style or characters of this show. Maybe it's because I'm too old for it even at the age of 18. Meh.
https://anilist.co/anime/98501/Youkai-Apartment-no-Yuuga-na-Nichijou/ Cheap Natsume.
https://anilist.co/anime/21595/Sakamoto-desu-ga/ This is a good idea for one short skit in Nichijou and that's it.
https://anilist.co/anime/20785/Absolute-Duo/ Ecchi moe swords and fighting stuff... really had to push myself to watch this one.
https://anilist.co/anime/71/Full-Metal-Panic/ Not really bad, just old. Not great anymore.
https://anilist.co/anime/21560/Berserk/ Berserk is a great show. This one in particular (2016) is not.
https://anilist.co/anime/21002/Under-The-Dog/ Really cool episode. Too bad it got no funding.
https://anilist.co/anime/15583/Date-A-Live/ Harem action trash.
https://anilist.co/anime/97815/FateGrand-Order-First-Order/ Mash is cute. That's about it.
https://anilist.co/anime/17729/Grisaia-no-Kajitsu/ Protagonist joins a school with a few girls with mental illnesses and during the harem, he fixes their illnesses sorta. Just stop watching after the bus crashes... That one scarred me a little.
https://anilist.co/anime/100240/Tokyo-Ghoulre/ Honourable mention to this pile of dog shit.
https://anilist.co/anime/98251/AhoGirl/ I did watch all of this but it's just not great for new fans or even weebs. You're scraping the bottom here.
https://anilist.co/anime/14515/SasamisanGanbaranai/ I didn't finish this one cause it was way too weird. Enjoy.
https://anilist.co/anime/1689/Byousoku-5-Centimeter/ Really pointless show. It's cozy sometimes but damn I felt like I just wasted my time.
https://anilist.co/anime/21639/Keijo/ I messaged that first girlfriend after about 6 years to say hi and that I guess I can forgive her, and she told me she was watching this show. Definitely glad shes an ex. I'm happy to say I haven't talked to her since.
https://anilist.co/anime/20910/Shimoneta-to-Iu-Gainen-ga-Sonzai-Shinai-Taikutsu-na-Sekai/ I honestly didn't think there was a show that could be further down on this list than KEIJO!!!! but here we are. Yes, this show actually aired on TV. A lot of firsts for me with this show. First time stopping an episode 4mins in to rethink what the fuck I'm doing and take a breather. First time actually gagging at something gross. TL;DR is all lewd things are banned so these people run around yelling profanities and distributing porn in the nude.

Interesting show combos that may not be obvious:
Monogatari + Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou
Koi to Uso + Kuzu no Honkai and then watch Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai
Overlord + Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken
Steins;Gate + Death Note
